This directory contains tests that verify the installation of the software dependecies and the software in this repo. This is done by verifying that the sample data provided in this repo can be read in and used to construct an instance of the optimization model, and the open source solver GLPK can being the process of solving that model. We terminate the solution process prematurely because we only need to see that the alogithms from glpk can be executed on the model constructed.
