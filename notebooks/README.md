# Notebook Examples

The [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb) notebook provides an example of reading in data that defines a vehicle routing problem, creating an instance of that vehicle routing problem, solving it, and saving the solution. The problem solved seeks to come up with a set of bus routes, as well as the number and size of bus on each of route in a manner that minimizes hourly energy consumption at the Dallas Fort-Worth international Airport (DFW).

The [Read_and_Process_Saved_Solutions.ipynb](Read_and_Process_Saved_Solutions.ipynb) gives an example of reading and inspecting routes from a saved solution produced by the [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb) notebook.
